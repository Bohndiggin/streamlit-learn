# PART 1

1. Three Principles of effective Data communication are
    - it tells a story
    - It shows enough information
    - but not too much

2. Basics of Visual perception
    - Order: People tend to look at things in a specific order. This is often guided by hierarchy.
    - Hierarchy: This is the visual order of elements. It is often dictated by size, color, and apparent relationships.
    - Relationships: Imagry that is visually related can tell a story by the relationship, not just the data itself. It can also help guide the eye.
    - Convention: What do graphs typically look like?
    - Knowing these concepts can help me tell a story through data more effectively.

3. Appropriate Graphs for the Data
    - Comparison between Values: BAR charts!!!
    - Comparison to the Whole: Stacked Column/treemap column
    - Change over time: Column, line, area
    - Ranking Data: slope/bar but in order
    - Correlation: scatterplot/bubble
    - Geographical Charts: Colored maps! (OR BAR CHARTS)
    - Measuring a target: Simple gague,
    - Showing outliers: colored table
    - Knowing what graph to use and when to use it will be extremely helpful.

4. Misleading Visualizations
    - Telling the story in such a way as to mislead your audience.
    - By changing how data is presented, you can really mislead people. 
    - Graph1 Is misleading because the last datapoint is in the wrong spot. It leads people to believe that there is no change
    - Graph2 Is misleading because the scale is all off and it doesn't start at 0
    - Graph3 is misleading because it all doesn't add up to 100 % I frankly have no idea what's going on here.

5. Decluttering
    - Visualisation clutter is unnessecairy elements in a visualization that distract from the story of thae data.
    - The main components of a graph are: Lines, Labels, titles, axis names, others
    - Three techniques to clear a graph, Delete all elements, start with just the bars, reintroduce elements until it can be understood
    - Color is an excelent way to communicate with your graphs. It is an easy way to guide the viewer

# PART 2

1. Big storyline = Wage Gap

2. Main Points / needed visualizations:
    - Initial detection
    - Analysis of initial view
    - Is it education?
    - Is it age?
    - Is it industry experience?
    - Is it gender?
